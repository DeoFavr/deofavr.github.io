    <h2>About Deo Favr</h2>
    <p>
      Deo Favr, formerly known as Don Rodeo, is a Nigerian artist blending rhythm, emotion, and intellect.
      Born Favour Samuel Ufort Mensah, he began his musical journey at just seven years old, mimicking vocals
      and harmonizing with the songs playing daily in his household. It was his older brother’s gift of
      hip-hop DVDs that truly ignited his passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Today, Deo Favr is a singer, songwriter, and occasional producer whose sound cuts across Afrobeats,
      AfroPop, trap, and drill. His artistry is a fusion of street energy and soulful experimentation,
      drawing influence from both global and African legends. These include Wande Coal, Tekno, 2Face Idibia,
      D’banj, pSquare, Fela Kuti, Lagbaja, Sunny Ade, and Sunny Nneji, alongside global icons like Snoop Dogg,
      Notorious B.I.G, Juice WRLD, Big Sean, Young MA, Diplo, and the classical genius of Yanni and Enya.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Deo Favr is more than a musician—he’s a social scientist with academic degrees in both music and
      social sciences. This rare blend of creativity and intellectual depth gives his work a unique voice,
      as he seeks not just to entertain but to inspire and elevate.
